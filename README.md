## Project 1 - Dino Facts

### Summary

This project displays a dinasours infographic that is derived from data that is provided. The site will generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, the name of the human rather than species is displayed with no fact. When the user clicks the "Compare Me!" button, the inforgraphic is generated in a grid and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed are random per dinosaur with at least 6 different types of facts. One of the titles is always for a pigeon in which the tile shows, “All birds are considered live dinosaurs.”
